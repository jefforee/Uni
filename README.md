# Uni

Uni is an application that removes tracking parameters from links
shared on the web and swaps proprietary services with free and open
source alternative frontends.

Uni provides a share sheet so that users can seamlessly share links
both into and out of Uni, having the links cleaned up in the process.

Uni derives its name from Urchin Tracking Modules, or utms, a kind
of tracking parameter often including in links. Uni is a delicacy
that exists inside urchins, and similarly, Uni gives you the best
parts of links hidden underneath all of the tracking parameters.
